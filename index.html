            Visual Studio is an Coding platform that sort of works like Brackets. To set it up you have to search in a new tab "Visual Studio Code". Once you do that then you click the one that says download. Just plain old download. After you get on the page, you download Visual Studio by clicking the download button for the type of Computer you have. For example, I would download the Windows one because I have a Windows computer. Then you get on Visual Studio and make a folder called javascript arrays. and you can make your projects in that folder. The rest is just like Brackets except first you go to the Extentions icon on the left bar and click it. Once you click it, download Live Server in Extentions. To do that search Live Server in the search bar. And that's it.
